## Setup Environment

This section describes the hardware and software needed for this workshop, and how to configure them.
This workshop is designed for a BYOL (Bring Your Own Laptop) style hands-on-lab.

### Hardware & Software

- Memory: At least 4 GB+, strongly preferred 8 GB
- Operating System: Mac OS X (10.10.3+), Windows 10 Pro+ 64-bit, Ubuntu 12+, CentOS 7+.

### Install Docker

Docker runs natively on Mac, Windows and Linux.
This lab will use [Docker Community Edition (CE)](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).
Download the Docker CE edition for your machine from the [Docker Store](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community).

_NOTE_: Docker CE requires a fairly recent operating system version.
If your machine does not meet the requirements, then you need to install [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox).

This workshop is tested with Docker Community Edition `19.03.13-ce-rc10, build fec3683` on Ubuntu `20.04.1 LTS`.

### Docker Images

This tutorial uses a few Docker images and software.
Let's download them before we start the tutorial.

In order to download the Docker images we will be using `docker-compose`.
You can install `docker-compose` following the instructions provided in the doc [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Now, download the [docker-compose-pull-images.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-community-leaders/dockercommunity/master/content/en/docs/CommunityLeaders/EventHandbooks/Go/prerequisite/docker-compose-pull-images.yml) file and use the following command to pull the required images:

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-community-leaders/alphasite/master/pages/handbooks/go/scripts/docker-compose-pull-images.yml
docker-compose -f docker-compose-pull-images.yml pull --parallel
```

### Other Software

# Using image for the workshop

You can use the workshop image based in dind (docker in docker), dotnet and openvscode to buddle docker, dotnet and vscode editor in a package.

1. pull the image

```
docker pull ghcr.io/zhangxd6/dockerfornetworkshop:main
```

2. start the workshop

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 5027:5027 -p 5000:5000 -p 8080:8080 --privileged -v "$(pwd):/home/workspace:cached"  ghcr.io/zhangxd6/dockerfornetworkshop:main
```

3. access the vscode server

you will have to check the container log to find the url with token like 

```
Web UI available at http://localhost:3000/?tkn=ed93033e-e343-4e52-840a-8a7560de8c11
```

4. Once you open the vscode, you should be able to access the instruction.md buddled in image and intergated termial for the workshop
